# HTML5 Game Tutorial Code

This is the annotated source code for a [quick screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jsq-ZMYTgU) I did on starting a game with HTML5.

For more on the HTML5 Canvas, see [Dive into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/canvas.html).

For more info on requestAnimationFrame, [Mozilla has some great documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.requestAnimationFrame).
